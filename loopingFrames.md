## About the looping
Created a loopingFrames function where all the job was done for easier execution.

Set up the display window. 

Created two arrays of the images loaded. One being the reverse of the other.

While the window was still running:
- The images kept on looping 
- The previous image frame is overrided by a black background.
- For each image it was scaled down since the png files were big.
